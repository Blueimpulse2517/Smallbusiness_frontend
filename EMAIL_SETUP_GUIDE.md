# Email Setup Guide for Hotel Booking System

## Problem Fixed
The hotel owner was not receiving email notifications when customers made bookings. This has been fixed by:

1. âœ… Creating proper environment configuration
2. âœ… Improving error handling in email controller
3. âœ… Adding owner notification functionality
4. âœ… Updating frontend to show email status

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Configure Email Settings

Edit the `backend/.env` file with your actual email credentials:

```env
# Email Configuration
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_MAIL=your-email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASSWORD=your-app-password
ADMIN_EMAIL=hotel-owner@gmail.com

# Server Configuration
PORT=5000
```

### 2. Gmail Setup (Recommended)

1. **Enable 2-Factor Authentication** on your Gmail account
2. **Generate an App Password**:
   - Go to Google Account settings
   - Security â†’ 2-Step Verification â†’ App passwords
   - Generate a new app password for "Mail"
   - Use this password in `SMTP_PASSWORD`

### 3. Alternative Email Providers

You can use other email providers by changing the SMTP settings:

**Outlook/Hotmail:**
```env
SMTP_HOST=smtp-mail.outlook.com
SMTP_PORT=587
```

**Yahoo:**
```env
SMTP_HOST=smtp.mail.yahoo.com
SMTP_PORT=587
```

### 4. Test the Setup

1. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm start
   ```

2. Start the frontend:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Make a test booking and check:
   - Customer receives confirmation email
   - Owner receives notification email

## What's Fixed

### Backend Improvements
- âœ… Added proper error handling for email sending
- âœ… Both customer and owner emails are sent
- âœ… Detailed response messages indicate email status
- âœ… Environment variable validation

### Frontend Improvements
- âœ… Better user feedback showing email status
- âœ… Clear indication if owner notification failed
- âœ… Improved error messages

### Email Flow
1. **Customer books** â†’ Form submitted
2. **Customer email** â†’ Confirmation sent to customer
3. **Owner email** â†’ Notification sent to hotel owner

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Email configuration error"**
   - Check that `.env` file exists in `backend/` directory
